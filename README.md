### My thoughts

Metaplay’s report on the “Game Development Renaissance” is a glimpse at how the gaming industry is evolving. It highlights how new technology, smarter tools, and fresh strategies are enabling game developers to create better games while overcoming recent challenges like rising costs and shifting player expectations. I found it particularly interesting how developers are focusing on long-term engagement with high-quality games, live service models, and cross-platform functionality. It also mentions 71% of developers anticipate healthier hiring trends in the future, with fewer layoffs and studio closures.
